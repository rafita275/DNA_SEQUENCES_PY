# DNA_SEQUENCES_PY

This repository contains 2 python scripts and one text file.
The python scripts: DNA_scrip.py and DNA_test.py.

The file DNA_scrip.py contains all the functions needed to achieve the goal to calculate the linguistic complexity of a DNA sequences.
The file DNA_test.py conatins test functons to make sure all the functions used in the DNA_cript.py file work properly. The functions for this script are imported form the DNA_script.py file.

The text file, DNA_SEQUENCES.txt contains a random sequence of DNA to be used with the DNA_script.py file.

To run the DNA_script.py in the terminal simply type: python3 DNA_script.py DNA_SEQUENCE.txt
to test the functions with the DNA_test.py file simply type: pytest DNA_test.py
